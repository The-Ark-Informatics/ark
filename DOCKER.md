#The Ark on Docker

The [Docker](https://www.docker.com) configuration supplied in this repository allows quick and easy building of The Ark.

This configuration has four containers defined; MySQL, LDAP (Slapd), Tomcat and Maven. These containers are integrated together using [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose). 

###Usage

1. `cd docker/`
2. `docker-compose build`
3. `docker-compose up`

###Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose)


###Extra Commands

Command							| Usage
------------------------------|------------------------------
`docker-compose up -d` 			| Starts the containers in daemon mode meaining that no logs are printed to STDOUT
`docker-compose down -v` 		| Tears down all containers, and deletes all of the associated storage volumes.


###Passwords

The default passwords are contained in [`docker/env_file`]() and should be modified before the initial `docker-compose up`, as the services are configured in the first run of each container.

###Configuration
Inside `docker/env_file`, you can also set the following Environment Variables which will configure the software inside each container:

Environment Variable 			| Usage	                     | Default Value
------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------
`SKIPTEST`						| Skips running maven tests    | `1`

In addition to these variables, you can also add Environment Variables listed [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) to configure MySQL.

###Explaination
When `docker-compose up` is called for the first time, all 4 containers are started. The Maven and MySQL containers begin their work, compiling the web application and importing the base database respectively, while the Tomcat and LDAP containers wait for the output of Maven. The LDAP container waits until the ark-user-account jar has been created, as it is needed to populate the LDAP database with The Ark root account, and the Tomcat waits until ark.war has been created, and deploys it once is.

###Container Specific Quirks
For the maven container, we mount ~/.m2 to /root/.m2 so that all maven repositories are cached and that the users maven settings.xml file applies.

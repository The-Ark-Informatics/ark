page.content.one=Welcome to Enrolment and Tracking Application.Achieving a greater understanding of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors in health and disease is perhaps the greatest challenge for modern biomedical science. Genes, environmental factors and our lifestyle act both independently and in combination to influence our vulnerability to disease. Those countries with the most opportunity to make effective use of genomic information in basic science, clinical, and public health applications are those with total population and longitudinal data linked to family health records.

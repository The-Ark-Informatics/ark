		Cloud-based bioinformatics tools</h2>
	<p>Data is the primary asset of biomedical researchers, and the engine for both discovery and translational medical research. As the volume and sensitivity of research data increases, for example due to new technologies such as &lsquo;next-generation&rsquo; sequencing of human specimens linked to clinical datasets, so too does the requirement for access to application software for integrating and interrogating the different types of research data.&nbsp; Researchers often need to execute complicated queries and conduct analyses across multiple data types, such as phenotypic, genotypic, pedigree and biospecimen data.</p>
	<p>The Ark project was established within the Centre for Genetic Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics at the University of Western Australia in late 2009 to develop an open-source platform to support Australian and International biomedical researchers. The objective of The Ark project is to provide a suite of secure, integrated web-based tools that incorporate the majority of the functionality required to conduct a complex study or clinical trial.</p>
	<p>These tools will enable both clinical and basic science researchers, who collect and use clinical specimens and health information from any disease type, to better comprehend how underlying genetic variations/mutations interact with environmental factors to cause disease. The project has now delivered a Java-based solution that delivers the following capabilities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Create and configure a study;</li>
		<li>
			Define users and manage their roles and access permissions;</li>
		<li>
			Define and manage a research participant pool;</li>
		<li>
			Define and manage the collection of phenotypic research data;</li>
		<li>
			Dynamically generate Electronic Data Capture (EDC) forms for collecting most types of textual research data;</li>
		<li>
			Manage physical biospecimens and the associated data using a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS); and</li>
		<li>
			Generate reports.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This functionality has now been released as Production Version 1.0 on the NeCTAR National Servers Program infrastructure. The project team is currently focussed on supporting Version 1.0 and gathering the requirements for future functionality to be developed, deployed and supported on the NeCTAR computing infrastructure.</p>
	<p>The software has been designed and developed in accordance with the following guiding principles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The software should be web-based;</li>
		<li>
			One instance of the software should securely support multiple research studies and multiple users;</li>
		<li>
			The core application software should not be developed to suit any one study/project but rather should be configurable to suit a broad range of studies;</li>
		<li>
			The software should be as user-configurable as feasible through a browser-based graphical user interface;</li>
		<li>
			The software must be highly secure; and</li>
		<li>
			The software modules should be well integrated.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Cloud-based Bioinformatics Tool proposal was developed with the goal of implementing additional functionality required by our collaborators and the majority of medical researchers currently undertaking data collection and analysis projects.&nbsp; In addition to enriching existing capabilities this functionality includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Integration with the AAF authentication services;</li>
		<li>
			An integrated invoicing and billing module;</li>
		<li>
			A data extraction for analysis module;</li>
		<li>
			A pedigree (family) data management and visualisation module. Note that we have developed a prototype for a 3 dimensional pedigree visualisation tool that may be used as the basis for this module;</li>
		<li>
			Registry Management functionality for managing participant registries, such as the Australian Twin Registry; and</li>
		<li>
			A genotypic data management module.&nbsp; While Genetic data management doesn&#39;t fit in our traditional database management and web application view of data due to the shear mass of data, it is vital to maintain and manage the meta data describing genetic data and the processes that could be run on it.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Cloud-based Bioinformatics Tools project is a collaboration between the GOHaD (formerly Centre for Genetic Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics at The University of Western Australia), The Centre for Mega Epidemiology at Melbourne University, St John of God Hospital, and The Clinical Oncological Society of Australia (COSA).</p>

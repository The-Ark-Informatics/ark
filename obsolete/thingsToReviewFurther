1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/dao/DataExtractionDao.java   - added consent extraction

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/dao/StudyDao.java              "" plus added other id and lastname history search capability

List<Long> consentAfterFiltering = applyConsentStatusFilters(allTheData, search, idsAfterFiltering);

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/model/lims/entity/Biospecimen.java - remove the testing in toString method (for that matter maybe make toString do something useful)

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/model/study/entity/Person.java
 - we have an EAGER lookup of otherids but we can maybe make it lazy and then put changes in other places to make it eager where we are having "lazy issues"

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/model/study/entity/PersonLastnameHistory.java
- investigate if our database is acually behaving properly too .. and check in general

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/vo/OtherIDVO.java - how is it used?

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/vo/SubjectVO.java
- several objects null init

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/web/component/panel/table/DataTablePanel.html
- is anything else using this (this is the one that changes the verticality of Clinical Data printout)

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/web/component/panel/table/DataTablePanel.java
 - general review

1.1.1c/ark-common/src/main/java/au/org/theark/core/web/form/AbstractDetailForm.java - ignore...nl chars etc

1.1.1c/ark-container/pom.xml - ignore/delete http(s) forwarding?

1.1.1c/ark-container/src/main/java/au/org/theark/web/pages/home/BasePage.html - ignore - delete ( was removing hosted by)

1.1.1c/ark-container/src/main/java/au/org/theark/web/pages/reset/ResetPage.html

1.1.1c/ark-container/src/main/webapp/css/header.css -  do not commit this ... it is hiding header text up top

1.1.1c/ark-container/src/main/webapp/css/palette.css - commit color changes but not larger size (it gets a little large on smaller displays - do some ui checks)
- also get the adjusted gifs for the look

1.1.1c/ark-container/src/main/webapp/css/style.css	
- its a direct reference to the big long list of customfielddataview (does/should it apply throughout - review ui)  - probably a keeper or something to expand upon

1.1.1c/ark-container/src/main/webapp/css/welcome.css  - dont commit ... hostedbyimage makes this not necessary for us

1.1.1c/ark-container/src/main/webapp/html/index.html  - dont commit ... hostedbyimage makes this not necessary for us

 1.1.1c/ark-container/src/main/webapp/reportTemplates/otherid.jrxml	- maybe look at it in general and have a look at report permissions

1.1.1c/ark-lims/src/main/java/au/org/theark/lims/service/LimsAdminServiceImpl.java	-- adding subjectUID on printed labels ... do our users want this.

1.1.1c/ark-lims/src/main/java/au/org/theark/lims/web/component/biospecimen/batchaliquot/form/BatchAliquotBiospecimenForm.java - handling on numberformat exception...return to "customer"/screen as warning?  can it happen?
-- seemingly also fixes same thing travis used.

1.1.1c/ark-lims/src/main/java/au/org/theark/lims/web/component/biospecimen/form/BiospecimenListForm.java
-- in the export adds parent textual reference.

--needs merge.  George rmoved - Trav tweaked I think

1.1.1c/ark-phenotypic/src/main/java/au/org/theark/phenotypic/web/component/customfieldgroup/form/DetailForm.java
-- george doing comparison ( possibly not necessary given it can be done in query)

1.1.1c/ark-report/src/main/java/au/org/theark/report/model/vo/report/ConsentDetailsDataRow.java
 - review and test 
 - also it toString, equals/hash needed here in this way?

 1.1.1c/ark-report/src/main/java/au/org/theark/report/web/component/viewReport/ReportOutputPanel.html
- review whole other ids concept

1.1.1c/ark-report/src/main/java/au/org/theark/report/web/component/viewReport/studyLevelConsent/StudyLevelConsentOtherIDReportDataSource.java
 - try to break

1.1.1c/ark-study/src/main/java/au/org/theark/study/model/dao/StudyDao.java
- getPersonOtherIDList(     is probably unused.  check refs

1.1.1c/ark-study/src/main/java/au/org/theark/study/service/StudyServiceImpl.java
+	public List<OtherID> getPersonOtherIDList(Long personID) throws ArkSystemException {
+		return iStudyDao.getPersonOtherIDList(personID);
+	}   is probably not used....BUT!!!   maybe this or something in the actual look ups saves us the EAGER query that will drastically reduce db queries being fired off by hibernate


1.1.1c/ark-study/src/main/java/au/org/theark/study/web/component/subject/DetailPanel.html
- we may wish to look at this FROMA  UI perspective- it emphasises other ids a lot.  perhaps main line can sneak it at the bottom or something.

1.1.1c/ark-study/src/main/java/au/org/theark/study/web/component/subject/SearchResultListPanel.html
